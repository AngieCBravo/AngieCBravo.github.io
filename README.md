## Hi
I am Angie Bravo and I am majoring in *Journalism* at Lehigh University. I'm from Laredo, Texas, and am an aspiring New York Times writer. I've been passionate about writing since the fourth grade and became interested in politics in high school while on the policy debate team. This background led me to combine what I love the most and strive to be a political journalist. I am using this site to host my data journalism projects.
