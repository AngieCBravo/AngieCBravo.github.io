## Deportation Count By States with Highest Immigrant Population
This a column chart created using Chartbuilding demonstrating deportation count by the states with the highest immigrant populations. This data demonstrates the enormous gap in deportation count between three states: revealing Texas as the highest deportation state. This disparity points to possible causal factors such as political party affiliation.

![Immigration Demographics](https://github.com/AngieCBravo/AngieCBravo.github.io/blob/main/Immigration%20Demographics.png?raw=100x20)
Pew Research Center’s, “Key Findings About U.S. Immigrants,” was published in 2020 by Abby Budiman, a former research analyst. The article compiles data focused on immigrant demographics. 

Immigration became an increasingly polarizing issue amid the Trump era, igniting a myriad of contrasting perspectives. The data Pew Research Center provides establishes demographic information sourced primarily from Census surveys. The center cites 1980- 2000 decennial censuses and 2010, 2013-2018 American Community Surveys as their primary data sources. The American Community Surveys is made up of a demographics survey which asks for educational attainment, family members and employment statuses among other demographic data to create statistics about each category.  

The data aims to answer who and what comprises the immigrant population which lead to subsequent questions of how data can influence xenophobic views.  The demographic data provides key findings such as the primary states of residence, projections for immigrant population growth and a breakdown of immigrant English proficiency. English proficiency is a particular point of interest; skewed views often point to immigrants as not being able to speak English. This data has the potential to breakdown stereotypes by shifting points of view away from anti-immigrant narratives, especially as immigrant populations are expected to rise, according to the data. Though the infographic doesn’t highlight the final section in the data discussing the percentage within political parties that view immigrants as burdens, it is a significant point of information to note as reference as more data is compiled and presented to the public; changes in overall mindsets toward immigration may be documented.
